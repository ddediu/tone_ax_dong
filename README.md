# Psychometric methods and Signal Detection Theory uncover subtle differences in the perception of tone contrasts in speakers of *Kam* (*Dong*): the **Analysis Report**

This repository contains the `R` code and the resulting full **Analysis Report** accompanying the paper *Psychometric methods and Signal Detection Theory uncover subtle differences in the perception of tone contrasts in speakers of Kam (Dong)*.
The high-quality figures are available in the `./high_res_figs` folder.

Please note that, due to newer restrictions on data export enacted by the government of China, the primary data (housed in the folder `./input_files`) are **not** included and must be requested from the corresponding author (Manxiang Wu <manxiangwu1022@163.com>), as instructed in the paper.
As a consequence, the code will **not run** without the primary data, but the already compiled output document is included.

The structure of this folder is as follows:

  - `tone_ax_dong.html`: the `HTML` document containing the full **Analysis Report**;
  - `tone_ax_dong.Rmd`: the main `Rmarkdwon` script containing the `R` code implementing the data pre-processing and cleaning, the statistical analysis and the plots, and resulting in the `HTML` document that contains full **Analysis Report** (`tone_ax_dong.html`);
  - `README.md`: this `markdown` document, containing the readme for the project;
  - `LICENSE`: the text document containing the full text of the GPL3 license (under which this code is released);
  - `bibliography.bib` and `apa-6th-edition.csl`: the references used by the main `Rmarkdwon` script in `BibTeX` format and the APA 6th edition formatting style (as a `CSL` file);
  - the following subfolders are missing from this repository as they are empty on purpose:
    + `figures`: folder where the various figures generated by compiling the `Rmarkdwon` script would go (empty on purpose);
    + `cached_results`: folder containing various pre-computed computationally expensive intermediary results, which will be populated upon the first run of the main `Rmarkdwon` script (empty on purpose);
    + `input_files`: this folder should contain the primary data, but is unfortunately available only upon request (see above).
